## Introduction


Many scholars have argued that public libraries are an important resource as they provide the public not only with books or access to free internet, but also with the tools necessary to succeed socially, politically or economically [(Goulding, 3-5)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0961000604042965). However, in the city of Toronto, the development of the public library system has privileged certain geographical areas -- while neglecting others -- thus contributing to a clear social gap. **As a result, this essay will first provide a brief history of this institution and argue that the uneven dispersal of Toronto Public Library Branches throughout the 20th century has been harmful to its overarching purposes.**

## Historical Background

The early Toronto Public Library system built many of its early branches throughout what is now considered downtown Toronto. In 1882, the Ontario Legislature passed the “Free Libraries Act” which worked to “establish a free public library system in Toronto” [("History of Toronto Public Library")](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/about-the-library/library-history/).  On January 1st of the following year, the “free library By-law” was put into action, thus allowing for the creation of the Toronto Public Library system; this new system was -- and supposedly still is -- dedicated to providing educational resources to the public [("History of Toronto Public Library")](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/about-the-library/library-history/).  Subsequently, in 1884, two branches were built around "Yorkville Town Hall" and it is from this point onwards that countless branches were built in and around the downtown area [("History of Toronto Public Library")](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/about-the-library/library-history/).  For example, over the course of the 20th century, branches such as the Sanderson, College and Shaw, or Bloor and Gladstone located around what is now Downtown Toronto, were built in high numbers and within a close proximity to one another, while those in the north west section of the city such as York Woods, Jane and Sheppard and Woodview Park were constructed in few numbers and relatively far apart [("Hours and Locations")](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/hours-locations/); although this may have been attributed to population density -- there were more people living in the downtown region throughout the early to mid 20th century [(Careless, 2013)](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/toronto/) -- it is clear that this uneven development has begun to harm the library's goals.

## Uneven Development and its Affects on the Library's Purposes
This uneven development during the 20th century has been harmful to the library’s role as an economic resource. According to Dr. Anne Goulding’s article entitled “Libraries and Social Capital”, she argues that libraries are vital to forging “social capital” within a given population [(Goulding, 3)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0961000604042965). More specifically, by “social capital”, Goulding is referring to the “social resource” which is created through “formal and informal relationships between the people of a community” and outlines that it can lead to higher economic success; in other words, public libraries are vital to allowing citizens reach their full potential economically as it allows them to forge connections with others in their community [(Goulding,3)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0961000604042965). As a result, the sparse development of branches in the northwestern area of Toronto during the 20th century -- as opposed to those in the downtown area -- acts in opposition to this purpose as it has not provided an adequate amount of financial resources to all citizens. Despite being an institution which is meant to provide “social capital” for the purpose of improving the economic achievements of all citizens, the relatively large distance between certain branches in certain areas suggests that it is not adequately addressing income inequality. With this in mind, the Toronto Public Library should be allocating its resources in a more equal fashion, as those in the northwestern region earn much less than those in the downtown area. Specifically, although the average income for families in Toronto is roughly $87,000, those in the northern region average around $52,000 per year while those in the downtown region make around $84, 000 per year; overall, the history of these library branches is important as it has not allowed for this institution to properly alleviate the already existent income polarizations in the city [(2011 Household Survey, Ward 8)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/97a1-City-Planning-Ward-08-NHS-Profile-2011.pdf) [(2011 Household Survey, Ward 19)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9765-City-Planning-Ward-19-NHS-Profile-2011.pdf) [(2011 Census, Ward 8)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/977f-City-Planning-Ward-08-Profile-2011.pdf) [(2011 Census, Ward 19)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/8fa8-City-Planning-Ward-19-Profile-2011.pdf).

In addition, the geographical dispersal of Toronto Public Library Branches has also harmed its role as an educational institution. Like Dr. Goulding’s article, professor Stuart Ferguson also argues that public libraries produce “social capital”, but takes this a step further by focusing more on its relationship with education [(Ferguson, 22-31)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00049670.2012.10722299?needAccess=true). He suggests that they are not only spaces for creating “partnerships” but are also important in the ways in which they promote technological literacy and education [(Ferguson, 22-31)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00049670.2012.10722299?needAccess=true).  However, despite this, the Toronto Public Library’s sparse distribution of branches in north western Toronto over the 20th century has and continues to counteract this purpose as it does not provide educational resources in an equal fashion. As opposed to those living in the downtown core, citizens in and around the York Woods, Jane and Sheppard or Woodview park branches have historically had less educational opportunities as there are fewer library branches to access; the spatial distribution of the Toronto Public Library simply reveals that it has not been geared towards improving the educational achievements of all citizens in the city of Toronto. Nevertheless, the Toronto Public library needs to provide equal education opportunities as those living in the northwestern region of Toronto have and continue to underachieve academically. In particular, although 58% of people in the city have some sort of post-secondary education, only 40% of people in the northwest area of Toronto have this type of education as opposed to the 73% in the downtown area; thus, similar to the previous point, this uneven distribution is important as it has also not been entirely effective in dismantling already existent education disparities [(2011 Household Survey, Ward 8)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/97a1-City-Planning-Ward-08-NHS-Profile-2011.pdf) [(2011 Household Survey, Ward 19)](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9765-City-Planning-Ward-19-NHS-Profile-2011.pdf).

## Conclusion

This essay has demonstrated that the spatial history of the Toronto Public Library system has been harmful to its overarching purposes. As a result, the analysis presented is important as it does not work to attack the public library, but rather shines light on the future developments needed to decrease the social stratification within the city. In order to better serve neighborhoods such as those located in north west Toronto, public libraries must be relocated as their geographical proximities to one another and certain neighbourhoods have a significant impact on local citizens.
